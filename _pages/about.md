Hi! I am Hassan, a Ph.D. student in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Georgia Tech advised by Dr. [Evangelos Theodorou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dG9MV7oAAAAJ) and Dr. [Nader Sadegh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TS4freMAAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research confronts the trade-off between safety restrictions and performance objectives (stability, optimality, robustness, etc.) of control dynamical systems. My research interests lie in the intersections of control theory, dynamic optimization and machine learning to design the appropriate mathematical tools used to develop provably safe and robust optimal control and planning for safety-critical systems, especially those in uncertain (or stochastic!) environments . 

I received my Masterâ€™s degree in ECE in December 2018 from Georgia Tech with my thesis in optimal control entitled "[Infinite Horizon Nonlinear Quadratic Cost Regulator](https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/60821)".

I believe that "The alms of knowledge is to educate" and thus besides my academic work and research, I cofounded RoboHajr Team in 2013 and RoboHajr Maker Space and Educational Center in 2016. 

Im my free time, you may find me playing soccer (football). I also enjoy cooking, reading and hiking.
