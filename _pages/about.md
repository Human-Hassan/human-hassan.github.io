TEST Hello! I am Hassan, I develop control and optimization tools and algorithms for autonmous systems.

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [ACDS Lab](https://sites.gatech.edu/acds/) at Georgia Tech :honeybee: advised by Dr. [Evangelos Theodorou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dG9MV7oAAAAJ) and Dr. [Nader Sadegh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TS4freMAAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research interests lie in the intersections of control theory, dynamic optimization and machine learning. Specifically, my research confronts the trade-off between safety restrictions and performance objectives of dynamical (unceratin) systems. My recent interest explores Bayesian ML methods for learning and control of dynamical systems with safety and stability guarantees.

I received my Masterâ€™s degree in ECE in December 2018 from Georgia Tech in optimal control (Thesis: <strong>"[Infinite Horizon Nonlinear Quadratic Cost Regulator](https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/60821)"</strong>).

I believe that "The alms of knowledge is to educate" and thus besides my academic work and research, I cofounded RoboHajr Makerspace and Educational Center in 2013. 

Im my free time, you may find me playing football (soccer). I also enjoy cooking, reading and hiking.
