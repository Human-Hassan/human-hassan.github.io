notes for me:

to open the Projects page again, add
permalink: /Projects/
similarly, to open the Teaching page again, add
permalink: /Teaching/

to just remove them from the navigation bar, 
nav: false (or true if you want them to be in the nav bar)

for blog, it is removed. To add, go to blog dir and open the index.html and change

permalink: /page/:num/
