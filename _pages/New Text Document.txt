notes for me:

to open the Projects page again, add
permalink: /Projects/

The projects pages have been removed. To put back, check the original al-folio 
similarly, to open the Teaching page again, add
permalink: /Teaching/

to just remove them from the navigation bar, 
nav: false (or true if you want them to be in the nav bar)

for blog, it is removed. To add, go to the config file, add blog_name and premalink:

blog_name: al-folio  # your blog must have a name for it to show up in the nav bar
blog_description: a simple whitespace theme for academics
permalink: /blog/:year/:title/
