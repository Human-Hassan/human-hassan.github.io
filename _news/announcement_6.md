I'm presenting our work on barrier states in trajectory optimization,<strong>[Safety Embedded Differential Dynamic Programming Using Discrete Barrier States](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9682554)</strong>, at ICRA 2022 in Philly and barrier states in dynamic games, <strong>[Barrier States Embedded Iterative Dynamic Game for Robust and Safe Trajectory Optimization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9867501)</strong> at ACC 2022 in Atlanta.
