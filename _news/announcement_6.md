I'm presenting our work on barrier states in trajectory optimization,<strong>[Safety Embedded Differential Dynamic Programming Using Discrete Barrier States]</strong>(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9682554) ,at ICRA 2022 on Philly in dynamic games, [Barrier States Embedded Iterative Dynamic Game for Robust and Safe Trajectory Optimization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9867501) at ACC 2022 in Atlanta.
